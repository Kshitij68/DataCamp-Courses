"""
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data
E.g. clustering customers by their purchases
Compressing the data using purchase patterns

Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
    Supervised learning finds patterns for a prediction task
    Eg classify tumor as benign or cancerous (labels)

    Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data
    But without a specific prediction task in hand

Cluster labels for new samples
    New samples can be assigned to existing clusters
    K-Means remembers the mean of each cluster (the 'centroids')
    Finds the nearest centroid to each new sample
